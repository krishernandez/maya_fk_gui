# maya_fk_gui
This module is focused on practicing on how to make custom GUIs for tools in 
Maya. The script that is running within the GUI selects and manipulates joints and curves 
in Maya, including history deletion, transformation freezing, and constraints. This can be
used for simple FK controls. The original script used, was referenced from class material.
